### Beam

Beam is a tool that lets you transfer a pipe between two machines over regular ssh. It doesn't bother itself
with the actual contents being piped. This essentially means you can use it to transfer files between machines
as well.

For example, here's a demo tail-ing a log file from one machine on the other.
